# CodexContinueGPT Integration Workflow Guide

This guide outlines how to effectively integrate CodexContinueGPT (CC-GPT) into your daily workflow for file management, organization, and decision-making.

## Core Principles

1. **Consult Before Acting** - Ask CC-GPT for advice before performing file operations
2. **Verify After Changes** - Confirm changes were appropriate after implementation
3. **Document Decisions** - Keep track of organization decisions and reasoning
4. **Automate Repetitive Tasks** - Use the cc-advisor.sh script for common operations

## Daily Workflow Integration

### 1. Beginning of Work Session

Start each work session with a quick consultation:

```bash
# Ask about pending organization tasks
./cc-advisor.sh ask "What file organization tasks are pending for our DB-GPT project?"

# Check if any recent changes need follow-up
./cc-advisor.sh ask "Based on our recent file organization changes, are there any follow-up tasks I should complete today?"
```

### 2. File Creation Workflow

When creating new files:

```bash
# Ask where new files should go
./cc-advisor.sh ask "I'm creating a new [type] file called [name]. Where should I place it in our project structure?"

# Verify file location after creation
./cc-advisor.sh verify "I created [file] in [location]. Is this the right place?"
```

### 3. File Movement Workflow

When moving files:

```bash
# Use the cc-advisor.sh move function
./cc-advisor.sh move /path/to/source/file.txt /path/to/destination/

# For multiple similar files, use bulk-move
./cc-advisor.sh bulk-move "*.md" /path/to/destination/
```

### 4. File Cleanup Workflow

When cleaning up or deleting files:

```bash
# Consult before deletion
./cc-advisor.sh cleanup /path/to/file/to/delete.txt

# Ask about bulk cleanup
./cc-advisor.sh ask "I want to clean up these temporary files: [list]. Is it safe to delete them?"
```

### 5. Project Organization Workflow

For larger organization efforts:

```bash
# Use the organize-docs function
./cc-advisor.sh organize-docs

# Use the organize-scripts function
./cc-advisor.sh organize-scripts

# Ask about specific categories
./cc-advisor.sh ask "How should we organize our [category] files for better maintainability?"
```

## Decision Documentation

Create an organization decision log to track file organization decisions:

```bash
# After making organization decisions, document them
./cc-advisor.sh ask "Please summarize our organization decisions for [category] files and explain the reasoning behind them."
```

Then add this summary to your decision log.

## Collaboration with Team Members

Share the cc-advisor.sh approach with team members:

1. Demonstrate the workflow in a shared session
2. Document example uses in your project README
3. Encourage consistent use across the team

## Maintenance and Updates

Periodically review and update the cc-advisor.sh script:

```bash
# Ask about potential improvements
./cc-advisor.sh ask "How can we improve our cc-advisor.sh script based on our usage patterns?"
```

Update the script based on the feedback and evolving project needs.
