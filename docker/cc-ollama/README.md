# CodexContinue-GPT (cc-ollama)

This directory contains the files and scripts for the CodexContinue-GPT project, a shell-based AI assistant with auto-model selection capabilities.

## Directory Name

This directory was renamed from `oi-ollama` to `cc-ollama` to better reflect its contents and purpose:

- **cc**: Stands for **CodexContinue**, the current name of the project
- **ollama**: Indicates that the tools use the Ollama framework for running AI models locally

> **Note**: The original name "oi-ollama" was used when the initial goal was to integrate Open Interpreter with the project. As the project evolved into CodexContinue-GPT, the directory name was updated to reflect this change.

## Contents

This directory contains:

- Installation scripts for CodexContinue-GPT
- Docker configuration files
- Shell scripts for interacting with Ollama models
- Verification and testing utilities
- Documentation and examples

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, see:
- `README-CodexContinueGPT.md` - Project-specific documentation

```bash
