# Shell Assistant - A Natural Language Interface

This new approach makes interacting with shell commands and aliases more natural and intuitive. Instead of structured lessons, you can simply ask questions in your own words.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Ask questions like "How do I manage Ollama models?" or "What's the best way to navigate in this project?"
- **Instant Access to Relevant Commands**: Get straight to the commands you need without going through structured lessons
- **Real Examples**: Each response includes practical examples of how to use the aliases
- **Flexible Interface**: Use it interactively or ask specific questions directly from the command line

## Usage

```bash
# Start interactive chat
./shell-assistant.sh

# Ask a specific question directly
./shell-assistant.sh --question "How do I use git in this project?"

# Get help
./shell-assistant.sh --help
```

## Benefits Over Traditional Training

1. **Learn at Your Own Pace**: No need to follow a linear curriculum
2. **Task-Oriented**: Start with what you want to do, not what the system wants to teach
3. **Contextual Learning**: Learn commands in the context of real tasks
4. **Quick Reference**: Get just the information you need when you need it

## Examples of Questions You Can Ask

- "What aliases are available for working with git?"
- "How do I start an Ollama model?"
- "What's the quickest way to navigate to the project root?"
- "Show me commands for code auditing"
- "How can I ask questions to different models?"
- "What should I do to get started with this project?"
