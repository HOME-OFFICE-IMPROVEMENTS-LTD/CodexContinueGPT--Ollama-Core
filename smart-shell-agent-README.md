# Smart Shell Agent: Natural Language Assistant for DB-GPT

The Smart Shell Agent is a revolutionary approach to interacting with the DB-GPT project. Instead of structured training modules, it provides a natural language interface that allows you to ask questions, get help, and collaborate in a more intuitive way.

## üåü Key Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Ask questions in plain English about how to accomplish tasks
- **Repository Knowledge**: The agent understands the DB-GPT project structure and purpose
- **Proactive Assistance**: Get suggestions for improvements and best practices
- **Collaborative Work**: Work together with the agent on complex tasks
- **Comprehensive Alias Knowledge**: Learn about aliases through natural conversation
- **Background Tasks**: Run and manage background tasks easily
- **Documentation Access**: Full access to project documentation for context-aware responses
- **Git Management**: Tools for cleaning up unwanted files and managing repository

## üí° Why This Approach?

Traditional training modules and structured lessons can be overwhelming and less intuitive for users. The Smart Shell Agent takes a different approach:

1. **Learn by Doing**: Get help when you need it, in the context of your actual work
2. **Natural Interaction**: Communicate with the agent as you would with a human colleague
3. **Just-in-Time Learning**: Discover features and commands as they become relevant to your tasks
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with basic information and dive deeper as needed

## üöÄ Getting Started

To start using the Smart Shell Agent, run:

```bash
./run-smart-shell-agent.sh
```

You can also build or rebuild the model first:

```bash
./run-smart-shell-agent.sh --build
```

## üìã Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask the Smart Shell Agent:

- "How do I work with git in this project?"
- "What aliases are available for managing Ollama models?"
- "I need to check my agent tasks, what command should I use?"
- "Can you explain how the MCP server works?"
- "What background tasks should I be running?"
- "Help me set up my development environment"
- "How can I improve performance of the Ollama integration?"
- "Let's work together on improving the documentation"

## üîÑ Versus Traditional Training

| Traditional Training | Smart Shell Agent |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Structured lessons | Natural conversation |
| Linear progression | Learn what you need, when you need it |
| Requires dedicated time | Integrates with your workflow |
| One-size-fits-all approach | Adapts to your knowledge level |
| Separate from work tasks | Helps with actual work tasks |

## üîß Advanced Usage

The Smart Shell Agent can do more than just answer questions:

- **Run background tasks**: `./run-smart-shell-agent.sh --background`
- **Get improvement suggestions**: `./run-smart-shell-agent.sh --suggest`
- **Start a collaborative session**: `./run-smart-shell-agent.sh --collaborate`
- **Clean up and commit changes**: `./run-smart-shell-agent.sh --cleanup`

## üßπ Repository Management

To help keep your repository clean and well-maintained, the Smart Shell Agent comes with repository management tools:

- **Enhanced Git Analysis**: `./enhanced_analyze_untracked.sh` helps analyze untracked files and provides recommendations for which files to commit and which to add to .gitignore
- **Cleanup Integration**: `./run-smart-shell-agent.sh --cleanup` provides an interactive way to stage and commit changes while cleaning up unwanted files
