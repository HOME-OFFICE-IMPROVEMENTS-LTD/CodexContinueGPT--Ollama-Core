# Today's Enhancements (May 17, 2025)

## CodexContinueGPT Enhancements

### Direct Query Support
- Implemented direct query support to allow non-interactive usage of CodexContinueGPT
- Added proper argument parsing to distinguish between options and query text
- Implemented both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Fixed line ending issues (DOS vs. Unix) causing script execution problems
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

### File Organization
- Reorganized Ollama documentation files from root to `/docs/ollama/`
- Moved CC-GPT related scripts from root to `/docker/cc-ollama/`
- Created a standardized structure for easier maintenance

### Collaboration Strategy
- Created `cc-advisor.sh` for integrating CodexContinueGPT into workflow
- Implemented functions for consulting CodexContinueGPT before file operations
- Established pre-action consultation and verification pattern
- Added safety checks with backup creation before any file operations

## Usage Examples

### Direct Query Mode
```bash
# Code-related query
cc --auto "Write a function to sort an array in JavaScript"

# Task management query
cc --auto "Create a todo list for my project"

# General knowledge query
cc --auto "Tell me about artificial intelligence"
```

### CC-Advisor Usage
```bash
# Ask for advice
./cc-advisor.sh ask "What's the best place to store our Ollama documentation files?"

# Move a file with consultation
./cc-advisor.sh move /path/to/file.md /path/to/target/directory

# Clean up a file with consultation
./cc-advisor.sh cleanup /path/to/unnecessary/file.md

# Verify an organization decision
./cc-advisor.sh verify "Did we correctly organize the shell agent files?"
```
